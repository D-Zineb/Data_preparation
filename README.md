Data_preparation
==============================

The purpose of this project is to make my  first attempt to realize data science projects for different issues: Regression, classification and multiclassification based on .csv files available on kaggle .This project is more interested in the data preparation part .

Needs of this project / Steps taken
------------
- Data exploration .
- Data analytics .
- Data preprocessing .
- Prediction . (SVM : SVC & SVR) .
